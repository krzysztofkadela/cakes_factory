## Responsiveness 

**Media Query Testing:**
- Below you will see the use of CSS media queries to ensure the layout adjusts based on different screen widths. For example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

```
          /* -------------------------------- Media Queries */

          /* Slightly larger container on xl screens */
          @media (min-width: 1200px) {
              .container {
                max-width: 80%;
              }
            }

          @media (max-width: 992px) {
              .form-control {
                  width: 80%;
                  font-size: 0.9rem;
                  padding: 0.5rem;
              }
          }

            /* fixed top navbar only on medium and up */
            @media (min-width: 992px) {
                .fixed-top-desktop-only {
                    position: fixed;
                    top: 0;
                    right: 0;
                    left: 0;
                    z-index: 1030;
                }
            
                .header-container {
                    padding-top: 164px;
                }
            }
            
            /* pad the top a bit when navbar is collapsed on mobile */
            @media (max-width: 991px) {
                .header-container {
                    padding-top: 116px;
                }
            
                body {
                    height: calc(100vh - 116px);
                }
            }

            @media (max-width: 576px) {
              footer .row {
                text-align: center;
              }
              #mc_embed_signup {
                margin: 0 auto;
              }
            }
            @media (max-width: 992px) {
              .newsletter-field {
                  left: -1000px;
                  font-size: 0.8rem;
                  width: 70%;
              }
          }

          @media (max-width: 992px) {
              .content-box {
                  margin-top: 60px;
              }
          }
```

- Tested Across Different Browsers:
Tried the functionality on different browsers, but the issue persists.
Despite following all of the above debugging steps, the toast dismissal function still doesn’t work as expected.

Both of these issues have been thoroughly tested and debugged, but unfortunately, no changes have been achieved. I have discussed them with the community on Slack and have gone through the course walkthrough again, but the errors remain unresolved.
